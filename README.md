# Car Dealership Inventory Management System
This Python program aims to create a simple inventory management system for a car dealership. The program represents vehicles using a class, with attributes for maximum speed, mileage, and seating capacity. It includes functionalities to assign seating capacity, set default color, and display properties of vehicles.

## Tasks Implemented:
1.  Vehicle Class Creation:
   -   A Python class named Vehicle is created to represent vehicles.
   -   Each vehicle object has attributes for maximum speed and mileage.

2.  Default Color Setting:
   -  The class is updated to assign a default color, "white", to all vehicles.

3.  Seating Capacity Assignment:
   -  Methods are added to the Vehicle class to assign seating capacity to a vehicle.

4.  Property Display Method:
   -  A method is created within the Vehicle class to display all properties of an object.

5. Object Creation:
-  Two objects of the Vehicle class are created:
    -   Car 1: Maximum speed of 200kmph, mileage of 20kmpl, and seating capacity of 5.
    -   Car 2: Maximum speed of 180kmph, mileage of 25kmpl, and seating capacity of 4.
